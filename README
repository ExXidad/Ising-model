Program creates res folder where the solution dumps are stored as an 2D array. Name of the dump is it's iteration.
To simulate the Ising model on a square lattice first create instance of the Solver class:

 Solver($grid size$, $spin-spin interaction parameter J$, $spin-field parameter H$, $temperature$);

 Boltzmann constant assumed as 1
 Then start solver passing number of iterations to compute:

 Solver::solve($number of iterations$);

 To compute temperature sweep use this:

 solver.temperatureSweep($TMin$, $TMax$, $Number of points$, $Number of iterations per point$, $Whether to use log scale$);

 If $Whether to use log scale$ equals true, temperature sweep will be computed in log scale as 10^T.
 Sweep os exported to the temperatureSweep file in format
 $Temperature$ $Mean energy per spin$ $Mean spin$ $Mean magnetic susceptibility$
